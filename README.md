# capstone project
Fraudulent Check Detection (Capstone Project)  This project was developed as my senior capstone project under the supervision of JPMorgan Chase software engineers. The goal was to design and implement a machine learning pipeline that detects fraudulent checks with high accuracy using deep learning and OCR techniques.

Project Overview

Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify check images as fraudulent or genuine.

Implemented image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, resizing, noise removal) and OCR-based text extraction for feature enrichment.

Enhanced performance through hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and dropout regularization.

Achieved 95% F1-score, reflecting strong precision and recall in fraud detection.

Developed the end-to-end workflow in Google Colab, from preprocessing to model evaluation.

Tech Stack

Languages/Frameworks: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Tesseract OCR

Tools: Google Colab, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Methods: Supervised learning, CNN, OCR, hyperparameter tuning

Key Outcomes

Designed a scalable ML pipeline that can be extended to other document verification use cases.

Strengthened collaboration with industry mentors at JPMorgan Chase, gaining exposure to real-world financial risk problems.

Delivered a proof-of-concept system that balances accuracy and efficiency for potential enterprise deployment.
